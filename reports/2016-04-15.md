Today I'm trying a new experiment - reporting all the official releases in the last week.

If you are a maintainer of an offical project you can do three things to help make this easier:

* Tag your releases in git, "x.y.z"
* Merge all changes via GitHub PR. Even small changes by the primary maintainer should go through a PR,
  even if they are simply immediately merged by the author. This makes it easier to scan the logs for
  notable changes by only reading the merges. Even better if @bors makes all merges.
* Ideally, write a changelog, [like this one](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Here are the releases from [The Rust Project] for the week spanning 2016-04-08 to 2016-04-15.
This report covers projects in the [rust-lang], [rust-lang-nursery] and [rust-lang-deprecated] GitHub organizations.

## lazy_static 0.2.0 (released 2016-04-13)

* [Refactored macro to change nightly-cfg behavior
  pre-expansion][lazy-static-m].
* [Allow the macro to coexist with `deny(unsafe_code)`][lazy-static-c].

  to declare `feature(const_fn)`][lazy-static-u].

## lazy_static 0.1.16 (released 2016-04-11)

  absolute path for `Box`.

## libc 0.2.10 (released 2016-04-12)

* [Fix `CPU_SET`, `CPU_ISSET`][libc-c].

  function, instead of the obsolete `bsd_signal`][libc-s].
* [Add locale support][libc-ll].
* [Add more locale support][libc-l].
* [`RTL_DEFAULT` is definied for Android andBSD][libc-r].
* [Link to libraries when disabling `use_std`][libc-st].

* [Add several pthread functions to Dragonfly and FreeBSD][libc-d].
* [Add `clock_getres`][libc-gr].
* [Add `openpty` and `forkpty` for non-Apple platforms][libc-f].

## [regex 0.1.66][] (released 2016-04-14)

[regex 0.1.66]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0166

* Speculative support for Unicode word boundaries was added to the DFA. This
  should remove the last common case that disqualified use of the DFA.
* An optimization that scanned for suffix literals and then matched the regular
  expression in reverse was removed because it had worst case quadratic time
  complexity. It was replaced with a more limited optimization where, given any
  regex of the form `re$`, it will be matched in reverse from the end of the
  haystack.
* [PR #202](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/202):
  The inner loop of the DFA was heavily optimized to improve cache locality
  and reduce the overall number of instructions run on each iteration. This
  represents the first use of `unsafe` in `regex` (to elide bounds checks).
* [PR #200](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/200):
  Use of the `mempool` crate (which used thread local storage) was replaced
  with a faster version of a similar API in @Amanieu's `thread_local` crate.
  It should reduce contention when using a regex from multiple threads
  simultaneously.
* PCRE2 JIT benchmarks were added. A benchmark comparison can be found
  [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/14683c01993e91689f7206a18675901b).
  (Includes a comparison with PCRE1's JIT and Oniguruma.)
* A bug where word boundaries weren't being matched correctly in the DFA was
  fixed. This only affected use of `bytes::Regex`.
* [#160](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/issues/160):
  `Captures` now has a `Debug` impl.

## rustfmt 0.4.1 (released 2016-04-13)

* [Return non-zero exit code if there are errors][rustfmt-nz].
* [Be careful about where we change braces in closures][rustfmt-cb].
* [Handle variadic function types][rustfmt-vf].
* [Change the logic around breaking multiple patterns in match
  arms][rustfmt-mp].
* [Add `fn_arg_one_line` option][rustfmt-fa].
* [Fix incorrect indent with `fn_args_layout: Block`][rustfmt-ci].
* [Format closed ranges][rustfmt-cr].
* [Properly format macros with an extra ident][rustfmt-id].
