[regex 0.1.68]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0168

Released 2016-04-24.

* [PR #210](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/210):
  Fixed a performance bug in `bytes::Regex::replace` where `extend` was used
  instead of `extend_from_slice`.
* [PR #211](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/211):
  Fixed a bug in the handling of word boundaries in the DFA.
* [PR #213](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/213):
  Added RE2 and Tcl to the benchmark harness. Also added a CLI utility from
  running regexes using any of the following regex engines: PCRE1, PCRE2,
  Oniguruma, RE2, Tcl and of course Rust's own regexes.

## [regex 0.1.67][]

[regex 0.1.67]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0167

Released 2016-04-22.

  Fix undefined behavior in the `regex!` compiler plugin macro.
* [PR #205](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/205):
  More improvements to DFA performance. Competitive with RE2. See PR for
  benchmarks.
* [PR #209](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex/pull/209):
  Release 0.1.66 was semver incompatible since it required a newer version
  of Rust than previous releases. This PR fixes that. (And `0.1.66` was
  yanked.)
